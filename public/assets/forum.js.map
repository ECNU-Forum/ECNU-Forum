Lowercase jquery is used because AMD module names are\n// derived from file names, and jQuery is normally delivered in a lowercase\n// file name. Do this after creating the global so that if an AMD module wants\n// to call noConflict to hide this version of jQuery, it will work.\n\n// Note that for maximum portability, libraries that are not jQuery should\n// declare themselves as anonymous modules, and avoid setting a global if an\n// AMD loader is present. jQuery is a special case.

Imagine going\n\t// from `1,2,3,4,5` to `4,5,1,2,3` where the numbers are not necessarily the keys, but the indices\n\t// corresponding to the keyed nodes in the old list (keyed nodes `e,d,c,b,a` => `b,a,e,d,c` would\n\t//  match the above lists, for example).\n\t//\n\t// In there are two increasing subsequences: `4,5` and `1,2,3`, the latter being the longest. We\n\t// can update those nodes without moving them, and only call `insertNode` on `4` and `5`.\n\t//\n\t// @localvoid adapted the algo to also support node deletions and insertions (the `lis` is actually\n\t// the longest increasing subsequence *of old nodes still present in the new list*).\n\t//\n\t// It is a general algorithm that is fireproof in all circumstances, but it requires the allocation\n\t// and the construction of a `key => oldIndex` map, and three arrays (one with `newIndex => oldIndex`,\n\t// the `LIS` and a temporary one to create the LIS).\n\t//\n\t// So we cheat where we can: if the tails of the lists are identical, they are guaranteed to be part of\n\t// the LIS and can be updated without moving them.\n\t//\n\t// If two nodes are swapped, they are guaranteed not to be part of the LIS, and must be moved (with\n\t// the exception of the last node if the list is fully reversed).\n\t//\n\t// ## Finding the next sibling.\n\t//\n\t// `updateNode()` and `createNode()` expect a nextSibling parameter to perform DOM operations.\n\t// When the list is being traversed top-down, at any index, the DOM nodes up to the previous\n\t// vnode reflect the content of the new list, whereas the rest of the DOM nodes reflect the old\n\t// list. The next sibling must be looked for in the old list using `getNextSibling(... oldStart + 1 ...)`.\n\t//\n\t// In the other scenarios (swaps, upwards traversal, map-based diff),\n\t// the new vnodes list is traversed upwards. The DOM nodes at the bottom of the list reflect the\n\t// bottom part of the new vnodes list, and we can use the `v.dom`  value of the previous node\n\t// as the next sibling (cached in the `nextSibling` variable).\n\n\n\t// ## DOM node moves\n\t//\n\t// In most scenarios `updateNode()` and `createNode()` perform the DOM operations. However,\n\t// this is not the case if the node moved (second and fourth part of the diff algo). We move\n\t// the old DOM nodes before updateNode runs because it enables us to use the cached `nextSibling`\n\t// variable rather than fetching it using `getNextSibling()`.\n\t//\n\t// The fourth part of the diff currently inserts nodes unconditionally, leading to issues\n\t// like #1791 and #1999. We need to be smarter about those situations where adjascent old\n\t// nodes remain together in the new list in a way that isn't covered by parts one and\n\t// three of the diff algo.\n\n\tfunction

A component\n * generates a virtual DOM to be rendered on each redraw.\n *\n * Essentially, this is a wrapper for Mithril's components that adds several useful features:\n *\n *  - In the `oninit` and `onbeforeupdate` lifecycle hooks, we store vnode attrs in `this.attrs.\n *    This allows us to use attrs across components without having to pass the vnode to every single\n *    method.\n *  - The static `initAttrs` method allows a convenient way to provide defaults (or to otherwise modify)\n *    the attrs that have been passed into a component.\n *  - When the component is created in the DOM, we store its DOM element under `this.element`; this lets\n *    us use jQuery to modify child DOM state from internal methods via the `this.$()` method.\n *  - A convenience `component` method, which serves as an alternative to hyperscript and JSX.\n *\n * As with other Mithril components, components extending Component can be initialized\n * and nested using JSX, hyperscript, or a combination of both. The `component` method can also\n * be used.\n *\n * @example\n * return m('div', <MyComponent foo=\"bar\"><p>Hello World</p></MyComponent>);\n *\n * @example\n * return m('div', MyComponent.component({foo: 'bar'), m('p', 'Hello World!'));\n *\n * @see https://mithril.js.org/components.html\n */\nexport default abstract class Component<Attrs extends ComponentAttrs = ComponentAttrs, State = undefined> implements Mithril.ClassComponent<Attrs> {\n  /**\n   * The root DOM element for the component.\n   */\n  protected element!: Element;\n\n  /**\n   * The attributes passed into the component.\n   *\n   * @see https://mithril.js.org/components.html#passing-data-to-components\n   */\n  protected attrs!: Attrs;\n\n  /**\n   * Class component state that is persisted between redraws.\n   *\n   * Updating this will **not** automatically trigger a redraw, unlike\n   * other frameworks.\n   *\n   * This is different to Vnode state, which is always an instance of your\n   * class component.\n   *\n   * This is `undefined` by default.\n   */\n  protected state!: State;\n\n  /**\n   * @inheritdoc\n   */\n  abstract view(vnode: Mithril.Vnode<Attrs, this>): Mithril.Children;\n\n  /**\n   * @inheritdoc\n   */\n  oninit(vnode: Mithril.Vnode<Attrs, this>) {\n    this.setAttrs(vnode.attrs);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @inheritdoc\n   */\n  oncreate(vnode: Mithril.VnodeDOM<Attrs, this>) {\n    this.element = vnode.dom;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @inheritdoc\n   */\n  onbeforeupdate(vnode: Mithril.VnodeDOM<Attrs, this>) {\n    this.setAttrs(vnode.attrs);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @inheritdoc\n   */\n  onupdate(vnode: Mithril.VnodeDOM<Attrs, this>) {}\n\n  /**\n   * @inheritdoc\n   */\n  onbeforeremove(vnode: Mithril.VnodeDOM<Attrs, this>) {}\n\n  /**\n   * @inheritdoc\n   */\n  onremove(vnode: Mithril.VnodeDOM<Attrs, this>) {}\n\n  /**\n   * Returns a jQuery object for this component's element.
